## Introduction
The MediaPipe Pose Landmarker task lets you detect landmarks of human bodies in an image or video. You can use this task to identify key
body locations, analyze posture, and categorize movements. This task uses machine learning (ML) models that work with single images or videos. The Pose detection recognition system is one that uses computer vision to detect the overall body figure. This project showcases pose detection using computer vision and a mediapipe algorithm or library. As we progress, you will see its applications in our everyday lives.

## Getting Started...

## Importing Necessary Libraries
I imported two important libraries which are openCV and MediaPipe. The OpenCV is used for the identification of my webcam in my compiter systemn while the MediaPipe is used for pose detection.
> *import cv2
import MediaPipe as mp**
